Open nets were found during extraction.

Open nets are composed of multiple resistively connected groups (RCGs).

StarRC attempts to determine the location where a net becomes open using
the topology of the extracted resistor network. However, this determination
is approximate. This determination is also affected by settings of the
REDUCTION, REDUCTION_MAX_DELAY_ERROR and EXTRACTION options.
